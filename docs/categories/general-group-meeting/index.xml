      <description>Time: 04:30 PM on Friday, November 9, 2018
Location: Bruininks 432 FREE FOOD!&amp;nbsp;Join us this Friday to discuss decentralized exchanges. Normal exchanges provide a single point of failure, which has resulted in numerous hacks and general uncertainty. Decentralized exchanges on the other hand offer a solution as they allow users to retain control of their funds throughout the trading process. We will discuss their advantages, disadvantages, and the status of current projects.</description>
